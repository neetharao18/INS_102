# DSA

This repository contains a Java program that generates keys from a given string using binary conversion and bit manipulation.

## About Key Generator
The Key Generator converts an input string into its binary representation and derives keys based on specific bit selection and transformation techniques. This method can be useful in cryptographic applications and security-based algorithms.

## Features
- Converts a string into its binary representation.
- Extracts specific bits to generate a seed value.
- Splits the seed into left and right parts and performs bitwise transformations.
- Generates 8 unique keys using predefined transformation indices and random bit exclusions.

## How the Code Works
1. The user inputs a string.
2. The string is converted to its binary representation.
3. Every 8th bit is extracted to form a base sequence.
4. The sequence is split into left and right parts.
5. The left and right parts undergo bitwise shifts based on predefined indices.
6. Random bit selections and exclusions are applied to create 8 unique keys.
7. The generated keys are displayed as output.

## Code Structure
- stringToBinary(String s): Converts a string to its binary representation.
- main(): Handles user input, calls stringToBinary(), and generates keys using bitwise operations and transformations.

## Usage
### Running the Program
To compile and run the program:
sh
javac KeyGenerator.java
java KeyGenerator


### Example Input/Output

Enter a string: hello
Binary Representation: 0110100001100101011011000110110001101111
Key 1 = 101010
Key 2 = 110110
Key 3 = 011100
...
Key 8 = 100011


## Notes
- The program selects bits based on predefined indices and randomization.
- The length and uniqueness of generated keys depend on the input string.
