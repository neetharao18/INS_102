# Secure Communication System in Java

This project demonstrates a complete secure communication system using **Java**, combining **RSA** and **AES** encryption with **digital signature verification** and **MySQL database** integration for key and message storage. It ensures **confidentiality**, **authenticity**, and **integrity** of transmitted data between a server and client via TCP sockets.

---

## Features

-  RSA Key Pair Generation (2048-bit)
-  AES Key Generation (256-bit)
-  Message Encryption using AES (CBC mode with IV)
-  Secure AES Key Encryption using RSA
-  Digital Signature Generation (SHA256withRSA)
-  Signature Verification on Client Side
-  Tamper Detection for Digital Signatures
-  Storage of Keys, Encrypted Messages, and Signatures in MySQL Database
-  TCP Socket Communication between Server and Client

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java SE**
- **Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)**
- **MySQL Database**
- **JDBC**
- **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**
- **TCP Socket Programming**

## MySQL Database Schema

### Database Name: `securedatabase`

#### Table 1: `rsa_keys`

| Column Name   | Data Type | Description             |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| user_id       | INT       | Primary key (e.g., 1)   |
| public_key    | TEXT      | RSA public key (Base64) |
| private_key   | TEXT      | RSA private key (Base64)|

#### Table 2: `encrypted_messages`

| Column Name       | Data Type | Description                     |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| user_id           | INT       | Foreign key to `rsa_keys`       |
| encrypted_key     | TEXT      | AES key encrypted with RSA      |
| encrypted_message | TEXT      | AES encrypted message           |
| digital_signature | TEXT      | Digital signature (Base64)      |

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- MySQL Server
- MySQL JDBC Driver (add to classpath)

### Step-by-Step

1. **Set up MySQL database**  
   - Create the database and tables using the schema above.
   - Update DB connection details in both `Server.java` and `Client.java`.

2. **Compile the Java Files**
   ```bash
   javac Server.java
   javac Client.java
   ```

3. **Run the Server**
   ```bash
   java Server
   ```

4. **Run the Client (in another terminal or machine)**
   ```bash
   java Client
   ```

## Output Preview

### When Signature is Valid:
```
‚úì The provided signature matches the server's signature.
üîì Decrypted message from server:
Hello, this is a secure message!
```

### When Signature is Tampered:
```
‚ùå The signature has been modified!
‚ö†Ô∏è The received signature and the provided signature do not match.
The integrity of the message has been compromised!
üîí Message decryption skipped due to failed signature verification.
```

## Security Concepts Demonstrated

- **Hybrid Encryption**: Combines RSA and AES to get the best of both security and speed.
- **Digital Signatures**: Ensures message integrity and authenticity.
- **Tamper Detection**: Client can detect if a signature or message was altered in transit.
- **Database Integration**: Keys and messages persist securely in a backend database.
